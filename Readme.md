WeepEngine Media Repository
===========================

In order to keep the main WeepEngine repository small, non-crucial assets, test scenes and other game-specific data is separated into this repository. You should clone this so that it's a subdirectory inside the engine's repository.

Most assets are not my own work. Licenses and attributions can be found in text files next to the files in question.

## Scenes

* `animtest.json`: Animation test scene
* `asteroids.json`: Asteroids clone as test for creating a simple 2d game
* `materialscene.json`: Auto-generated scene that contains all general purpose textures in this repo
* `outside.json`: Foliage test scene or something
* `platforms.json`: Test scene exported from Blender
* `pong.json`: Pong clone as a test game
* `skyrunner.json`: A small game where you try to run and jump to the end of a simple obstacle course
* `testscene.json`: General purpose test scene
* `voxelpainter.json`: Test scene exported from the "voxelpainter" tool (in the main repo)
